# ML-Course-Notes

* SciPy.org - python for scientific uses - alternative to matlab with python. free and open source
* most popular ML python framework: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
* Anaconda - data oriented python framework
  * in the anaconda navigaor, install:
    * Spider - ide
    * 
* coursera - you can get an actual degree, like data science degrees online (e.g. 'Mater of data science')
  * https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-data-science-hse?
  * most popular - 'Machine leaning' - https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?

* Kaggle - very important source for data sciense. social network for data science. 
has many datasets you can start working with.
  * see kaggle competitions/compete. google kaggle competitions solutions

## Terms

* Data mining
learn about data relationships as oppose to regular queries where we ask specific questions

See (see SciPy-kit):
* Supervised learning:
  * Classification
  * Regression 
* Unsupervised
  * Clustering - good fit for recommnedation like shows etc.
* Semi supervised - e.g. you have a dogs and cats pics but only a part is categorized to each group

  
* Reinforcement learning - learn for experience, e.g. games, robots
For example, in a game, you set the rules for winning and losing and have the computer run many times and learn how to improve.

* Online learning - coninuous learning
vs
* Batch learning - learn from db

* CRISP-DM - cross industry standard proess for data mining 
  1. business understanding
  2. data understanding 
  
  1, 2 iteratively 
  
  3. data preperation
  4. modeling
  
  3, 4 iteratively
  
  5. evolution
  
  goto 1
  
  6. deployment
  
  this process is iterative when we have new data
