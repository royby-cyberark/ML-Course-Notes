We genrally seperate ML into two categories: 
1. Supervised - marked data
   we have info on the target, e.g. is the pic a dog or a cat
   1.1 classification problems - tell me if its a dog or a cat
   1.2 req - ?
2. Unsupervised - unmarked data. we don't have the target value. e.g. 
   we're taking a group, e.g. a successful fertilization. 
   then, according to the parameters, we will try to infer for something we don't know.
   usually for recommendations. e.g. product recommendation.
   e.g. user is a studend, certain age, etc. then recommend a tv show.
